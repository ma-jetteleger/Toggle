Squares have "toggle targets" and, in fact, toggle their targets when clicked

The arrows seem to indicate that the "toggling" will propagate, it does not. Maybe there's a way to experiment with "toggling propagation" at some point in the future?

Little bit of doubt about the core mechanic (toggling other squares). It's not exactly fun by itself, without requiring a goal to be interesting to play with. Here there is very little that motivates you to "play around" the minimal play space

Originally, I intended to "turn off" the buttons that were clicked. Playing with the game while this feature isn't coded in makes me consider leaving them always interactable. Maybe this would make solving puzzles more interesting? Maybe I can have different types of buttons, some that turn off after being used, some that don't? I hadn't considered this possibility before testing the game in between the implementation of the intended basic features

## 2024-09-02

Rudimentary array is set up, squares are interactable

There is some feedback on hovering and on clicking the square. It seemed intuitive to implement both in terms of basic interactivity with the components but I'm not sure if there is going to be any value in the hovered feedback in the long run

## 2024-09-02

Setting up project, writing original intentions

## 2024-09-03

New levels can be generated at will on pressing the return key

Unrelated to that, squares can effectively be "useless" if they only have a left arrow and are positioned at the beginning of the array, or only a right arrow and positioned at the end. I'm wondering if this is an interesting bit of obfuscation? Or will it be unnecessary "noise" in the player reading of a level?

If unnecessary, I should either remove that arrow or make it so that only applicable interactions are generated by the level creation algorithm

Added a readme + process and design documentation

I figured it would be useful to have a record of the "instructions" for the game. Whether or not their included textually in the game, it'll be interesting to see how/if these evolve

(some additional thoughts on this: board games can afford to have explicit textual "external" instructions about how to play the game, but video game designer burden themselves with the task of teaching the players their game "from within" the game. Why is that? Can we be lazy and just handout instructions to our players instead of designing tutorials?)

## 2024-09-04

A solution/challenge is generated so that the play has a pattern of squares to match in a number of clicks

The solution is fully random for now (the number of clicks for the solution is also random within a range)

This is done because I have no idea of heuristics that indicate whether some aspects or a level's configuration (or its goal) make it more interesting than another, those will have to wait

? Should the solution/goal include the possibility of clicking the same square more than once?

Unrelated to the solution/goal thing but I should find  better way to indicate a self target than a "down" arrow

Also: I should settle on a single term for the solution/goal/challenge of a level. For documentation but also for my sanity. We'll see what sticks

## 2024-09-05

Completed the core loop with some "flow" between levels when completing a level

Level completion feedback is half satisfactory for now (trying to lean into the "squareness" of the game as much as possible), there's a button to generate a new level when done with the current one and also the game stops you from being able to click more squares when you complete a level

It's possible that the level is already completed when generated. That's a problem of course, I'll patch that in the level generation algorithm at some point soon

## 2024-09-05

Quick preliminary aesthetic pass

- Removed the rounded corners because it was ugly
- Changed colors to different degrees of white/black/grey (Added a "background" to the level. Experimented with the contrast between the square outline and level background, which one should be lighter than the other, that kind of stuff)
- Made the goal squares as wide as the interactive squares. This is an attempt to fix the weird/unintuitive perceptual mappings between the two. They still needed to look different so I made the goal "squares" a lot flatter

## 2024-09-06

Added a todo entry for prettier visuals

Implemented the restrictions regarding the clicks counter

Since I don't know what I want to do with this yet, I added a "feature switch" in the Unity inspector to choose from a Hard Restriction (can't click on squares passed the goal # of clicks), a Soft Restriction (can click and solve the level passed the goal # of clicks, but can't move on to next level), and no restriction ($ of clicks is only sort of a suggestion)

Let's figure out what's best later (maybe even keep all the different options and reward the player/progress through the game differently according to different play styles)

The shake + red feedback is a bit much for now

## 2024-09-06

Clicks counter + undo/redo/reset buttons

Adding the possibility of navigating the "history" of the puzzle being solved seemed important. However, after implementing these features and playing with them, I realized one thing: it's a bit unintuitive to navigate the history of a puzzle being solved if there's no "movement" within the puzzle

What I mean is that undoing or redoing a move feels weird when you can't actually see the "move" go in reverse. Now it just seems like another move is being made, instead of navigating the history of already-made moves

First time I'm actually seeing this hurdle in minimalism. I guess it's a consequence of making a game with no movement at all (think movement metaphor for interaction in Svanaes 2000)

Adding some animations or some indicators of "made moves" that can animate or backtrack could solve this

## 2024-09-11

Changed the arrow sprites to match the overarching square aesthetics

Also changed the "self targeting" indicator. The down arrow was confusing and it was also interfering with the possible use of the down arrow to indicate a "toggle down target" if we ever move to a 2D playing field

## 2024-09-11

[tech] Made the ClicksCounter feedback animations cancellable so that they don't mess up the interface

## 2024-09-19

Added a final thought to the todo

Brainstormed the aforementioned "twisted mechanics" list

+ a reflection on expanding design spaces

## 2024-09-19

Process documentation for the previous work session

Didn't have the time to reflect on my work last time, so I did it now

Also added a reflection on "finding the fun" and the next steps for the projects, focusing on "figuring things out" instead of coding and implementing features

## 2024-09-19

Not generating already solved levels anymore

This is the first and very obvious heuristic to implement in order to generate "interesting" levels

## 2024-09-25

Journaling

## 2024-09-25

Added a feedforward/telegraphing feature to show the toggling predictions of clicking on a square

The intent of this is to ease gameplay/exploration with the level. I feel that knowing a bit more about what's going to happen as you're *about* to interact with a square will go a long way

This extra important in this kind of game because nothing is really telling you what's going to happen "naturally". Affordances are hidden, therefore feedback and feedforward and signifiers are doing all the heavy lifting

I'm pretty happy with the feel of it and the level of information it's giving. It's making interaction with the squares "richer", in that it supports anticipation, not just trial and error

I'm not happy with the look of it, though, but I'll revisit that some other time

## 2024-09-25

Longer arrays

Pulled back the camera a little to allow the generation of longer arrays

The intention is the generate more diversity in randomly generated levels.  I felt like a square range of 3 to 6 wasn't allowing levels diverse enough to give a concrete idea of the range of possible puzzles

An issue might be size of the squares on a phone, though, but we'll see about that later

## 2024-09-25

Made it so squares aren't assigned "superfluous" target arrows

So the leftmost square cannot toggle to the left, and the rightmost square cannot toggle to the right

I'm hoping applying this heuristic makes for more interesting levels or at the very least levels that are easier to read/play in

Light level generation tuning + minor visual polishes

I wanted to get some builds ready and available for testing so I did some fine tuning like changing the range of clicks for objectives

Before, it could go as low as 2 on any level and that felt really underwhelming on longer arrays. I Changed it so it's always 1 fewer than the number of squares in a level. That decision was almost arbitrary, but the intention is that longer levels are consistently more difficult than smaller ones (I'm under the impression that more clicks == harder? I should probably test that hypothesis at some point)

Also changed made it so undoing and resetting is possible a when a level is completed. This opens up the possibility of players completing levels with different amounts of clicks. This way, we can reward them for specific solutions. Right now I decided that solving a level with the exact amount of clicks is harder/rewarded with a special animation (Just a change of color, really... Minimalism, you know. In a world of black and white and grey, green should be appreciated in a special way)

Finally, I decided to be thorough and explicit with the readme/how to play. So the game is playable by reading the complete set of instructions even though the in-game feedback and signifiers are not sufficient

## 2024-10-04

Displayed the number of clicks for every possible solution of a level on the UI

This indicates the broader goal of a level: playing out all possible solutions

It invites players to do so even though they might not have realized multiple solutions were possible

I might make this "feature" optional, like allowing players to go to the next level after completing only one solution, but rewarding players "more" (how???) if they complete all solutions before moving on to the next level

(I needed to decide on an order for the display, I went this highest to lowest as I feel this what players would intuitively do when going through multiple solutions, but when testing I immediately did the opposite... mmm)

((also should we limit possible solutions to only one per amount of clicks? e.g. only one with 3 clicks, even though multiple solutions with 3 clicks are possible? It feels a bit weird to have the same number twice on the list))

(((also should find a way to display/inform the player of the solutions that they previously succeeded at completing so they don't accidentally re-do the same one over and over (happened to me when testing), this is going to be tricky since the order of the clicks don't matter.... I'm thinking of "printing" the solutions as thin rectangles (indicating the squares involved in a solution, with no info on the order) under the array after they've been completed by the player)))

## 2024-10-04

Added some code to test and output all possible solutions toward a goal arrangement of squares

This brought to light a very important piece of information about generated levels and their solutions. The order in which the squares are clicked is not important! This is a huge eye-opening moment and I will document this and its implications further in the journal

This is part of a feature to allow/have players "play out" all the possible solutions of a level in a order to truly solve it

## 2024-10-11

Implemented a working version of the multiple solution feature

In this "mode", the players have to find all solutions to a puzzle before moving on to the next

They do have the reset the puzzle manually in order to try out and complete new solutions. Maybe we should do this automatically through a quick animation

There is also a problem: when you have multiple solutions and, for example, they're of lengths 2 and 4, you can just do the one with length 2 + press any square twice and that'll "give" you the one of length 4 without actually finding the true length 4 solution. I can solve this by making the squares only able to be clicked once per level. This will limit me in considering new features, like the conditional toggles that I was thinking about. But it's a necessary change for now, we can always explore other solution that problem later

## 2024-10-15

Updated the feedback document to cross out which comment has been accounted for

Also added an unused variable to remind me that one of the next step should soon be to implement some kind of progression (that will be optionally turned off, for debug purposes)

## 2024-10-15

Introduced the "wrap around" toggle features

Maybe a feature that will be a step in the level progression?

Someone suggested doing that during the feedback session last week. It was pretty quick to implement since it was just a matter of supporting the actual wrap around functionality + preview graphics with the existing "useless arrows" that I removed some time ago

This should add a touch of complexity on the otherwise very linear level solving experience

## 2024-10-15

Change the placeholder arrows for the UI history buttons

There was some confusion about the functionality of these button during the playtests. I assume the confusion mostly took place because I was still using the placeholder image files and they had little to no visual indication about what the button they were on did.

I changed to a more "universal" iconography for undo/redo/reset in the hopes of clearing that confusion. I also changed the color of the arrow when the button isn't interactable to make it more clear that it isn't (faded grey = does nothing)

## 2024-10-15

Remembered another bit of feedback and organized the feedback document a little

## 2024-10-15

Organized the Todo document and translated some of the feedback received last week into todo entries

## 2024-10-15

Forced the generation of multiple solutions levels in multi-solution mode and forced the generation of single solution levels in single solution mode

It felt weird to generate levels that didn't directly fill the properties of the mode they were in. "multiple solutions mode" shouldn't just "allow" for multiple solutions, but offer only that, and vice versa

Thinking of affordances, it would feel weird if a door afforded opening, but only sometimes

Basically, I was looking to add consistency to the design of the level generation algorithm

## 2024-10-15

Made squares uninteractable on click

This is so squares are only able to be clicked once per level. This solves the issue of "cheating" multiple solutions by clicking a number of times on the same square

Not 100% happy with the visual feedback of it, a light "fading" of the toggle indicator. I can't really have a big overlay with a bar that crosses out a square or that obscures the color of a square because we still need to be able to see if a square is toggled on or off

We'll need to test if that indicated uninteractability adequately

## 2024-10-16

Started to work on settings menu, but shelving this for now

This is to enable players to choose different game modes, turn on or off features and tweak the level generation algorithm from the game itself

I imported the settings menu from another project, thinking I could quickly hook up some of the basic the options from this game onto it, but it turns out it's a bit more complicated than that so I'll be shelving this for later. I'm not sure if it's even necessary

The quick and dirty version of what I'm trying to do is just to build two different versions of the game. One in multiple solution mode, the other in single solution mode

## 2024-10-16

## 2024-10-17

Added a very rudimentary progression scheme + questions document

So the progression only goes up linearly by added a square to the array every time players complete two levels. It will definitely be fleshed out more in the future but right now we have a semblance of progression + some UI feedback for how many levels cleared

There are debug controls to help with testing the progression mechanisms

I also added a "questions" document to compile the questions I ask myself about the game but that don't immediately translate into a todo entry or a reflection for the journal. I went back and added the questions I had in the past as well to show the evolution of the questions that pop up during development

BUT more importantly, the level generation algorithm is busted.... I don't know when this happened but the algorithm is spitting out impossible solutions... so I'm going to have to focus on this for a while since it's pretty important!

## 2024-10-18

Fixed the broken level generation bug

Solutions with the same amount of steps were compiled and suggested to the players when they shouldn't have and some of the solutions suggested weren't even possible to get to!

I fixed this, but now that multiple solutions are correctly enforced in multi-solution mode, I am now realizing that some level setups are just impossible to generate multiple solutions for. This is a pretty big design problem that calls for a longer reflection so I'll be writing in the journal about that

Pulling a pregenerated level from file is fonctional, but it's fully random

Next step is making it work with the progression by discriminating levels according to the "allowed" features for the progression level reached

## 2024-10-21

Started working on the code to generate/overwrite levels from a file

This is highly technical, I will reflect on the design implications once this "backend feature" is wrapped up

## 2024-10-22

Tiny update on the todo

## 2024-10-22

Implemented a working system to pull pregenerated levels from a file when it's impossible to generate valid solution with the random brute force level generate algorithm

It seems to be working pretty well! Working on this raised a bunch of questions about progression through the game's features as well

It also raised questions about replayability and about how much the players will be able to "see through" the cheats in the algorithm (specifically, will they see that we recycled already played levels if the algorithm fails?)

This will require testing for robustness but also more work to make sure this works on built versions of the game

## 2024-10-23

Updated description and todo + uploaded different builds for different versions on itch.io

The different versions of the game + the system to pull levels from file also work with the rudimentary progression system

## 2024-10-23

Finalized the system to pull prevalidated levels from file + added the description/how to play to the repo so we can see how it evolves over time

We now have two modes (single solution and multi solutions) that are fully consistent, and it should work on different platforms and on builds of the game, not just in the editor

While editing the description and how-to-play texts on the itch.io page that I'm maintaining so others can play and test the game, I realized that these edits should probably be documented MDM style as well, so I made a doc for this that I will be updating along the itch page

More easily editable progression with more features attached to it + bug fix

So the mechanisms for adding features gradually to the game through progression is in. I'm slowly introducing players to "more complex" target arrows now. It's hard to know if the base values that I chose are good enough so I'll need to test that

Also to not that having more restrictions on which arrows to choose from in the generation of a level does hinder the level generation algorithm and puts a high dependence on the "pull from file if can't generate a valid level" system

This also might mean that we have to accept having single solution level in multi-solution mode at first. I feel that if it's just the first levels and that single-solution levels don't show up after multi-solutions are introduced, it doesn't feel too inconsistent and is acceptable. This would even feel like accessing multi-solution level is part of the progression which is a nice accident

But we'll have to test for consistency

## 2024-11-01

Part of the bug fix I'm working on

## 2024-11-04

Fixed a minor bug with the clicks counter feedback in single solution mode + tweaked the progression

I'm also playing with different values for the progression, I'm feeling like the arrows aren't being introduced consistently enough because of the random nature of the algorithm, I might need to force the introduction on some progression features at specific progression index instead of letting the randomness do the work

## 2024-11-04

The "solution found" animation isn't shown when inputing a solution you already found + found some bugs to fix later

It was a confusing piece of feedback to be shown the "Solved" animation when you didn't actually solve anything new, I think it's better to only show it to the player they do

Implemented cascading toggles + journaling + todo editing

My thoughts on the design of the cascading toggles are in the journal

I also added tags on all the todo entries to categorize them between feature implementations, visuals, bug fixes or technical work. This could be useful in determining whether the work done (or the work that was thought of for later) involves changes to the game that are player facing or not and whether it changes the game's interactively or aesthetically

Todo markdown editing

## 2024-11-08

Crossed the todo entry for the last commit

## 2024-11-08

Wrote a simple function to sort the levels by square lengths in the prevalidated levels files

The point of this is to maximize the number of prevalidated levels we can stack up while testing/developing the game without having to order them manually

There still is a button we have to press. I might hook up the function to an automatic process at some point but since we also have to manually transfer the files from my local PC data to the project's resource folder in order for the levels to be built into the game, this will do for now. (That whole process can be automated at some point too, but we'll see if it's necessary later)

Right now I'll wait to have more levels with cascading toggles that are prevalidated before transfering the files to be built

## 2024-11-08

Bug fixes + journaling and todo editing + updated builds for testing

Fixed the issue of duplicating/non-destroying solution clicks boxes and the non-disappearing next level button

Edited some todo entries to record ideas I had about how to implement some features. I'm not sure if it's the right place to put those reflections/thoughts but since they're directly related to work items I intend on doing soon-ish, it made sense to write them there

I'm thinking: if something is partly implemented and I have thoughts about a further expansion/modification of that feature, I'll write these thoughts as in-code comments near the part(s) of the code that relate to that feature

If something isn't implemented and I have thoughts about a future/possible/potential feature, I'll write these thoughts in the todo entries about that feature

I also built updated versions of the two modes so they can be shared online and played/tested. The main update is the progression through targeting schemes + wrap around toggles and the "forced" single/multi solution that wasn't as robust and consistent before. Cascading toggles are also in but they're not meant as the focus of the next playtest

Oh and I also receive some spontaneous bits of feedback about the possibility of brute forcing levels, a suggestion to be able to "go back" and revisit prior levels and some preference for the single solution with its "hard edges"

I'd love to address the brute force issue but, to be honest, I'm not exactly sure it's possible to fix... maybe by throwing longer arrays at the players earlier? Maybe only smaller levels are easy to brute force? This is a little bit of a dead end for me as of right now... I'll have to revisit that issue later

The "revisit previous levels" feature sounds nice to me and shouldn't be too hard to implement, but I'm wondering about its value. Maybe it would help and support players in their learning of the game? Apart from that, I'm not sure of what it would bring to the experience

Finally, the mention of a satisfying red shaking response in single solution mode is interesting. I might be able to bring something similar to multi-solution mode? I'm not sure if it's compatible with this mode yet but I can try and few things to try and get the "best of both worlds", since I feel like I have a slight preference for multi-solution mode but, indeed, the feedback from busting the clicks counter in single-solution is pretty satisfying

## 2024-11-13

Preliminary setup for including cascading toggles in progression + typing up feedback entries

Received feedback from playtests and typed it up to address it. There isn't a clear "best mode" between multi and single solution. I hoped the playtests would help me decide on which mode to keep in the game but I received very good pros and cons for both approaches. The reception was slightly more negative for the multi-solution mode. Right now I'm wondering if there's anything I could "salvage" from the multi-solution mode to bring into single solution mode as a "best of both worlds" approach.

The other solution might be to progress from one to the other. We could test this soon as my next immediate task is to rework/polish the progression system

## 2024-11-15

Continued the setup for the progression system overhaul + removed the possibility for squares that aren't targeted by others to be cascading

The rationale for the progression system rework is the following: right now the level generation algorithm works in a way that levels are generated with random features that the progression system *allows* to be generated. This means that there is a possibility for a very late level, which allows for very advanced features, to have none of these features because of the random aspect. I want to change it to make it so features can be expected and ensured to be present on specific levels. More on that later

In the meantime, I wanted to exclude superfluous features like squares indicated as cascading that can't cascade because they can't be target by other squares. This is important because having a cascading indicator on something that can't cascade feels like a false signifier (a false affordance?) and the promise of well communicated, discoverable and usable interactive design would be somewhat broken

## 2024-11-18

Continued the setup for the progression system overhaul

The change to the progression system is going to require a major change to the level generation algorithm. Changing such a convoluted system is daunting so I started the process by reviewing the existing system to get a solid grasp on how it works so I can put my hands in the wires and pull what's necessary without breaking everything. I wrote a thorough block of pseudocode that goes through everything the algorithm does to generate a level, its squares and their features, its goal and its multiple possible solutions. After doing this, I feel that I have the necessary understanding of the system to actually change it, now

## 2024-11-22

Partial implementation of the new and improved progression system

Felt hopeless, now a little more hopeful, will journal about the emotional rollercoaster soon

## 2024-11-25

New and improved progression editing system is in

My main thoughts about this are in the journal.

I find it a bit counterintuitive when reflecting on the work that's done one a feature to have to choose between writing my thoughts in the commit message or in the journal...

My reflex is to keep the "big thoughts" about the "big features" for the journal, and the smaller, more local and quick thoughts for commit messages

This isn't always true

But if I'm working on a big feature or refactor or anything that requires me to spread progress for that feature over many days, chances are that I'll be writing about it in the journal and not in multiple commit messages...

## 2024-12-02

Tiny visual polish on the cascading indicator

Had to make the placement of the dot dependent on the targeting scheme so the relative positioning with the arrow wasn't ugly

## 2024-12-02

Finalized the level generation algorithm

I wrapped up the big change on the level generation algorithm by re-including the final pass that overwrites the level with a pregenerated, prevalidated level previously saved to a file in the case that the runtime generation fails. This marks the end of the work to be done in order to ensure that the progression features are included in level, as opposed to just allowed

## 2024-12-05

Last(?) tweaks to the progression system

This is the last "feature" I'll work on. Not exactly a new feature but I wanted to introduce the very basic mechanisms of the game through the progression system

Now players will start with a one-self-targeting-square level to learn the main mechanic of the game: clicking a square to toggle it on/off. The second level will be a 2-squares level with an side-arrow and a self-targeting square

My intention with these two levels is to make sure players understand how to interact with the game as its core (and how these interaction lead to the objective of the game) before actually trying solve challenges

I also tweaked a few things in the "save level to file" system so that we don't have duplicate levels in the files and that there can't be level with all self-targeting squares (except the first level) because even though the first levels are meant to be simple, that's just plain boring

## 2024-12-09

Tweaked progression to introduce cascading toggles on less complex targeting schemes first + experimented with different target prediction graphics (including the implementation of a version that supports/includes cascading toggle targets

My intentions here were again to smooth the difficulty curve of the game so that when the hardest feature of the game is introduced, it's not coupled with some other hard features. It was a lot easier to do than anticipated, I managed to build a progression "editing" system that allows for a lot of variety and control over which features are included when and it supported the changes I wanted to do here. Very satisfying

This should have been two different commits, but I also played around with the prediction graphic/feedback. I had received a comment at some point, saying that the prediction rectangle were revealing too much about the game. I made them a bit more cryptic, and also managed to display them in a way that supports the cascading feature (because they are now smaller and toggle/color agnostic)

I am excited to test these (new "final" progression + new prediction graphics) with new players

## 2024-12-11

Fixed a bug + updated the description of the game to match the itch.io page

## 2024-12-11

Added more obvious feedback for the clicks counter and the level cleared counter

A while ago I had received the feedback that the clicks counter was a bit too easy to ignore and gloss over. I made it bigger and added a little punch animation to make sure the play notices it when it changes, so its function is more obvious

This should help players learn the mechanisms of the game quicker

I also added a similar feedback to the levels cleared counter, to again help the players understand the function of the numbers they see across the screen. A few commits ago I removed the trophy graphic that was helping to illustrate that counter's function because it broke the minimalist intention of not connecting any game rule and mechanism to real world analogs. I'm hoping that the animation connects the number to the in-game moment of clearing a level

## 2024-12-18

Added the feedback I received from the latest playtest, along with todo entries that reflect what to do to address the feedback

I received a lot of positive feedback on the overall experience, progression and difficulty curve. Also about the general appeal and enjoyment of the game

The notes I took were mostly about the "negative" things. These were mostly small things that can be addressed with visual tweaks or adjustments on the progression, not necessarily big changes in the code. I'm glad

## 2024-12-26

Made the second level only one click so it's not pre-solved

This is to address the point of feedback I received about it feeling weird that the second level was (and players felt like it was possible that others could also be) pre-solved.

This is good for consistency. I had originally thought that having a single exception wouldn't bother players but apparently it did

Now all of the levels follow the exact same rules, no exception

Made it a bit more complicated to use the debug functions

I added an extra key to press in order to use the debug functions. A player stumbled upon those functions before and it basically broke the game/the experience for them so I made it so you need a to keep the D key pressed to use them. The intention is to make them impossible to trigger by accident

I also fixed a few bugs I had with the debug function and the resetting of early levels

Hid the redo/reset/undo buttons until a square is pressed for the first time

The intention here is to isolate the core interaction of the game as much as possible as the first thing the player should do.

Some time ago I saw some players hesitate and try and click all of the buttons that appeared on screen, including the UI buttons. To minimize that, I'm trying to hide them before the first square is clicked. I hope that this communicates to the player that those buttons are secondary to the middle buttons and that they are not integral to the gameplay

Made the level completion animation play every time a level is re-solved, with a bit of a difference

Players felt doubtful that they really solved a level if they didn't see the animation play every time they entered the correct solution. I previously deliberately stopped the animation from playing repeatedly to communicate that the level was already solved, but now I realized it created confusion.

I reinstalled the animation to be played repeatedly but changed it a bit. I made the graphic thinner and less colorful every time it's animated after the first time. That way, players can still be confirmed that the right solution is entered, but they can also see that the animation is different, indicating that the level is indeed already solved

Hid the levels cleared counter before a first level has been cleared + added a delay to the increment

This is done to help the players understand the meaning of that number. I hope seeing the number appear just after beating the first level + seeing the number go from 0 to 1 and not just jump to 1 will make its "function" more obvious

Added checks and crosses (+ changed the general position of the solution rectangles + added feedback on click/toggle) to help players read levels and the game's objective

The main piece of feedback I got from that last playtest was that the objective is not obvious when playing for the first time. After a discussion with the testers, I realised that this was mostly due to the solution rectangles being a bit to far away from the array of interactive square and that there wasn't enough feedback to connect what players were doing with the squares to the solution rectangles and therefore the objective of the level/game

By adding the checks and the crosses, my intention is to make it really obvious that these icon represent completion, and therefore are connecting what they're close to to the objective of the game. By moving the solution rectangles up and squeezing the checks and crosses between the two connected array, I'm hoping that the connection will be obvious

If it's still not obvious enough, I doubled down by adding bits of extra feedback when clicking and toggling squares. Squares now "bump" when toggled, along with their respective solution rectangle and even with the associated check or cross

With this, every connected object of the game animates at the same time, connecting the action the player has done to the game's reaction in a much more visually informative way

(I ran a small and simple survey with a few friends to figure out which layout of solution rectangles looked best and was more intuitive: above the squares or below. Above got 1 vote, below got 8)

## 2025-01-27

Added an animation + a delay for toggling

The latest feedback I got from having someone new try the game for the first time was that it's still not super clear what's happening. Even with the new animations, checks and crosses to emphasize mappings between different elements, it's still not great

I went back to the feedback I had received from past playtest sessions and revisited an old idea: to add a "nudge" animation to the arrow(s) of a clicked square to make the relationship between the squares and the "targeted toggles" more obvious

After having done that, I basically had to also implement a way to animation/separate/delay the cascading toggles, since it's basically an extension of the same feature

I also decided to remove the target prediction dots. Someone told me during last playtests that, even though they were meant to help in understanding the mechanics and relationship between the squares, they added noise to the screen and made things muddier. This struck a chord, since by making minimalist games I'm of course trying to minimize the noise and visual clutter. I believe that by adding the nudge animations and delays, these dots wouldn't be necessary anyway

Small tweaks, but mainly updating some of the process documents

## 2025-01-28

More tweaks on animations

Many minor tweaks on speed and delays here and there but specifically, I added a delay on the level complete animation to try and capture the attention of the player "sequentially" so that they look at things happening one by one instead of all at once

Oh and I changed the layout of the solution rectangles, which are now squares

This is to follow through with the idea that I wasn't being minimalistic enough. Checks, crosses and bumping rectangles were cluttering the visual space. Now with the delays and the animation MINUS the visual noise, I'm hoping the connection between the middle interactive squares and the bottom object squares is even clearer

Small tweaks on top of the last tweaks

## 2025-01-28

Tweaked the cascading toggles animation sequence

This is an attempt at making it very clear (and pretty)

## 2025-01-29

Changed the progression to address feedback I'd received

The comment I received a while back was that players needed more time between newly introduced mechanics to play around and understand the rules

So I extended amount of levels, distancing the points where new mechanics are added

I'll playtest this soon and see how it feels to other people

Fixed the major bug that allowed the generation of impossible levels

There was an issue with the way levels were generated after I added the animations and delays. I took a wild swing at troubleshooting it and managed to isolate what the issue was (I wasn't turning off cascading for the right squares when fake-clicking them to generate and display a solution)

I'm pretty happy with this. This was the last problem/major issue that I wanted to tackling before calling the game done

...

Of course I still have some tiny features I want to implement still... just some minor visual (and audio) things...

I was thinking a cute color change when beating levels (or every couple of levels, like when reaching a new mechanic), or a counter to indicate how many levels are part of the "official" progression. Oh and adding some audio feedback

We'll see if that happens or not! If not, I'm done

## 2025-02-05

Fixed a bug and a semi-bug + added feedback from last play session

Addressed a couple of issues that came up during the last feedback session.

One was a bug I had before and thought I fixed, I fixed it for good

The other was that multi-solution levels sneaking their way into the single solution mode (the actual game) felt buggy, so I figured that, since I can't always force single solution levels, I'll display the objective click counter for a level to show the solution with the least amount of clicks. That way, there might be more possible solutions to a level than the one the player achieved, but they won't know it. It's a cheap fix, but it should work

The other issue is that some levels are impossible. I investigated and, indeed, some levels are impossible to solve even with the provided solution... this is bothersome. They don't happen often but it's a problem for sure... I'll need to dig deeper for this one...

The other bits of feedback I received was that it was a good call to remove the prediction dots, to remove the checks and crosses, and to make the objective array squares instead of rectangles

Attempt at playing with colors + indicating the "total" amount of levels

I set up a way to swap in/out the color palette of the entire game. My intention is to use (monochromatic) color changes to reward the player for beating a certain amount of levels/indicate a shift in progression (when new mechanics are introduced, for example)

I've not yet decided on actual color schemes to implement but the system is there. This is the kind of decision that I don't like to make (i.e. deciding which colors to use), hence the original shades of grey. Making "concrete" decisions is hard, and I don't like doing that. I'd rather make abstract, systemic, algorithmic, pragmatic decisions that, in turn, affect the game's design (both aesthetically and gameplay-wise)

Still, the value of using color in the game is non-negligible, so I'm trying to outsource a little bit and find and get people motivated to pitch color schemes to use in the game. Another way to do this would be to find "pretty colors schemes" algorithmically, but I currently don't have a specific intuition how to approach this

This should have been two commits:

The second thing I did here is experiment with ways to communicate the "total" amount of levels in the game. Players ask me this all the time. Or similar questions like: "how many levels are there?", "How long is this?", etc.

It's not obvious at first that levels are procedurally generated so players don't know there's literally no end to this game. However, after 40 levels, no new mechanic is introduced and no change in the rules of configuration of the levels  is making the game harder, so I consider that, by beating 40 levels, you've functionally seen all that the game has to provide. It's still very much possible to continue playing, but you've pretty much "beaten" the game after 40 levels.

So I've tried adding a "/40" label to indicate that. Although I'm not a fan of integrating more visual information on screen, there should be a way to make this as minimal as possible

I've tried having that label fade and disappear after "informing" the player. I've tried making is part of the "levels cleared counter box", I've also tried having a non-numerical indicator (little squares filling up a big square). No one solution is sticking out as the best one yet. I've sent out screenshots and clips of multiple versions of this to father feedback about the preferred solution. To be continued...
