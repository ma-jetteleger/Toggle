# Description

## Single solution

Toggle is a game about the simplest form of interaction: selecting and activating something. It's a game about rules and interactions, or a game about pressing buttons.


How to play:


The goal of the game is to change the colors of the middle interactive set of squares so they match the array of colored rectangles at the bottom of the screen in the specified number of clicks at the bottom of the screen.


Squares can be in two states, represented by two different colors: black and white. Click on squares to toggle other squares (and/or themselves) between these two states.

- A diamond shape indicates that the squares targets itself to be toggled when clicked. 

- Left and right arrows indicate that the square targets its immediate neighbour(s). 

- Multiple shapes indicate that the square has multiple toggle targets which will all be toggled simultaneously when clicked.

- A dot on a square indicates that, when it is targeted and toggled by another clicked square, it will toggle its own target(s) immediately as well


The black dots that appear beneath the main array when hovering a square are showing you a prediction of the effect of clicking the hovered square. They indicate which ones of the squares above are going to be toggled, should you click the square you are hovering.


The buttons at the top-left side of the screen are, from left to right:

- Reset level

- Undo

- Redo
