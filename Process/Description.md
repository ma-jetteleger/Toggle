Toggle is a game about the simplest form of interaction: selecting and activating something. It's a game about rules and interactions, or a game about pressing buttons.

How to play:


The goal of the game is to change the colors of the middle interactive set of squares so they match the array of colored rectangles at the bottom of the screen in the specified number of clicks at the bottom of the screen.

- You can sometimes complete a level in fewer clicks, but the real challenge resides in completing it in that exact number of clicks.


Squares can be in two states, represented by two different colors: black and white. Click on squares to toggle other squares (and/or themselves) between these two states.

- A diamond shape indicates that the squares targets itself to be toggled when clicked. 

- Left and right arrows indicate that the square targets its immediate neighbour(s). 

- Multiple shapes indicate that the square has multiple toggle targets which will all be toggled simultaneously when clicked.


The black and white rectangles that appear beneath the main array when hovering a square are showing you a prediction of the effect of clicking the hovered square. They indicate the predicted color of the squares above, should you click the square you are hovering.


The buttons at the top-left side of the screen only feature placeholder sprites:

- The diamond button resets the level

- The left arrow button is an "undo" button

- The right arrow button is a "redo" button


A simple animation plays when you complete a level. Click the right arrow button that appears on the right side of the screen to generate a new level.

- Levels are randomly generated with no regards for any kind of difficulty progression

- Press the Enter key to generate a new level without completing the currently displayed one
