# Description

Toggle is a game about the simplest form of interaction: selecting and activating something. It's a game about rules and interactions, or a game about pressing buttons.


How to play:


The goal of the game is to change the colors of the middle interactive set of squares so they match the other array of squares underneath in the specified number of clicks shown at the bottom of the screen.


Squares can be in two states, represented by two different colors: black and white. Click on squares to toggle other squares (and/or themselves) between these two states.

- A diamond shape indicates that the squares targets itself to be toggled when clicked. 

- Left and right arrows indicate that the square targets its immediate neighbour(s). 

- Multiple shapes indicate that the square has multiple toggle targets which will all be toggled simultaneously when clicked.

- A dot on a square indicates that, when it is targeted and toggled by another clicked square, it will toggle its own target(s) immediately as well


The buttons at the top-left side of the screen are, from left to right:

- Reset level

- Undo

- Redo
