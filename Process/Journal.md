Today we start prototyping the game's concept! The idea is to present a bunch of squares to the player on a linear one dimensional array. When clicked, these squares will toggle a state change in themselves and/or other squares in the array. 

I haven't decided how these connections (between square clicking and square toggling) will be configured and how they will be displayed yet.

The goal for the player will be to have the squares match a "goal array" that show all the squares in the specific state they should be for the player to complete the level.

There will also be a total number of clicks for each specific level.

I'm thinking of generating those level procedurally first, as it'll make it way easier to iterate on different layouts and see if the idea is any interesting.
