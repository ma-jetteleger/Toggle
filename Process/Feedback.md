- ~~So focused on the center squares and glyphs, didn't notice the number for the clicks at first~~
	- ~~It needs to be bigger and displayed more prominently~~
+ Solid core loop, incentivizes you to keep going
+ Great format for a mobile game
+ Someone likes the totally random, not progressive way levels are spat out
	- ~~Most everyone else disliked that and would enjoy a progressive level generations scheme instead~~
? Brute forcing levels is possible (and also kinda fun?)
+ The game "gets you to play it" without an incentive
- ~~Felt overwhelmed beyond the first level (too many squares?)~~
+ Game is possible to understand and play without reading the rules (although an actual progression in the generation of the level would help a lot)
	+ Players learning by themselves might actually be a source of motivation
- ~~Dinstinguising between the UI and the actual game elements was not trivial~~
- Array of solution rectangles might look like a progress bar
- The function of the preview rectangles is not so obvious
- ~~Solutions can be figured out "too linearly" by going from left to right~~
	? ~~Introducing "wrap around toggles" for the end squares might be a solution~~
? Someone suggested to have mutliple "solution setup" for the same level

- Levels are possible to solve using only combinatorics, making the player progress through levels without learning anything about the game
? Would definitely like the option to easily revisit prior puzzles
? ~~Something inherently more satisfying in the red-shaking response in single-solution mode. More like there are some hard edges players can use to try to understand the "world"~~

? The two modes (multi-solution and single-solution) don't have to be mutually exclusive
	? The game could progress from single-solution to multi-solution levels (this suggests that multi-solution mode is generally harder than single-solution)
		? For doing this, it could be a good idea to reduce the number of squares at that point in the progression
- ~~Multi-solution mode is mostly frustrating/requires more uninteresting mental gymnastics~~
	- ~~Specifically to solve the levels in "more clicks than the optimal way"~~
	- ~~More clicks =/= more interesting levels~~
	- ~~It feels more like busywork~~
	- ~~It doesn't feel great to keep playing the same puzzle over and over for different solutions~~
+ Multi-solution mode creates some tension and "teasing" sort of engagement
+ Multi-solution mode is more accessible
	+ Allows for flexibility/more options in goal selection
+ ~~Single-solution mode has great feedback when busting the clicks counter~~
+ Squares being "spent" in multi-solution mode (only able to be clicked once) feels good and captures the puzzly feeling

- ~~The clicks counter was interpreted as the level number~~
- ~~The fact that the winning animation doesn't play every time the level is re-solved makes the player doubt if they actually successfully understood the goal and how to reach it~~
- ~~The goal of a level (to match the bottom array's colors) is not immediately understood~~
	- ~~The bottom array of rectangles is not easily interpreted as the objective of the level~~
? Some players suggested to have more levels between the introduction of new mechanics (slower pacing)
? Another suggestion was to have new mechanics introduced in isolation (cut out the other mechanics when introducing a new one)
- ~~A player tried to play with the keyboard, triggering the debug fonctions~~
- ~~Some players did not understand the meaning of the number on the top right of the UI (the cleared level counter)~~
- ~~The wrap around arrows aren't emphasized enough~~
- The cascading indicator dot isn't great, a player suggested using a "wave" icon
? ~~Someone suggested to have a "nudge" animation so that the arrows that target and togle a square "push" a little bit in the direction of the square to emphasize the targeting of that square~~
+ The progression is well paced and well organized, the mechanics are put in the right order and it makes for a satisfying, gradually more difficult (and gradually more "positively frustrating") experience
- ~~It felt/looked weird to have a level already solved (the second level)~~
+ People are really looking for a mobile version

- ~~The animation all happening at once is making it really hard to read what's going on~~
- ~~The game might be to maximalistic, the predictions dots and the checks and crosses add visual noise and might actually be distracting from the actual rules/mechanics of the game~~
- ~~Being so rigidly minimalistic about not including movement might hinder the experience of learning the game for new players~~

## 2025-01-31

+ ~~Checks and crosses feel like too much handholding, it's also redundant information~~
+ ~~Square shaped objective array feels better then the thin rectangles for "mapping"/associating it with the interactive middle array~~
? There's a clear distinction between two types of players: the ones that don't feel very engaged with the game because they don't understand what's going on and there's not enough feedback and information to get them going; and the ones that feel very stimulated by the lack of information and the motivation they feel to figure out what's going on and what to do with minimal feedback
- ~~There's a bug that happens when you spam click on a square~~
- ~~There was a level that had an impossible solution, it seems like it built its solution with a cascading toggle on a square not going away after being activated~~
- ~~Some people remarked that having multi-solution levels (which sneak their way in the game as a fallback to not being able to generate a level) in the game feels weird~~
- People don't know when they're supposed to be done with the game
