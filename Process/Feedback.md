- So focused on the center squares and glyphs, didn't notice the number for the clicks at first
	- It needs to be bigger and displayed more prominently
+ Solid core loop, incentivizes you to keep going
+ Great format for a mobile game
+ Someone likes the totally random, not progressive way levels are spat out
	- Most everyone else disliked that and would enjoy a progressive level generations scheme instead
? Brute forcing levels is possible (and also kinda fun?)
+ The game "gets you to play it" without an incentive
~~- Felt overwhelmed beyond the first level (too many squares?)~~
+ Game is possible to understand and play without reading the rules (although an actual progression in the generation of the level would help a lot)
	+ Players learning by themselves might actually be a source of motivation
- ~~Dinstinguising between the UI and the actual game elements was not trivial~~
- Array of solution rectangles might look like a progress bar
- The function of the preview rectangles is not so obvious
- ~~Solutions can be figured out "too linearly" by going from left to right~~
	? ~~Introducing "wrap around toggles" for the end squares might be a solution~~
? Someone suggested to have mutliple "solution setup" for the same level

- Levels are possible to solve using only combinatorics, making the player progress through levels without learning anything about the game
? Would definitely like the option to easily revisit prior puzzles
? Something inherently more satisfying in the red-shaking response in single-solution mode. More like there are some hard edges players can use to try to understand the "world"
